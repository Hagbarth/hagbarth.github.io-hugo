So I read this [Medium post](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-structure-your-day-for-optimal-performance-and-productivity-dcbf0665e3f3)
about how you should get up really early in the morning and work very focused for about 5 ours before doing anything else.

Well - I'm not gonna get up at 5am as the guy who wrote the post does. That's just not me. But I **am** gonna get up at *before* 7am and make sure that I'm ready to work by that time. Why? Because the post outlines a thing, that I've been thinking about for a while.

> Being focused while working matters. A lot! - Probably Einstein

Anyway. I'm writing this a 12:30 am sooooh, but I promises I will. keep. to. this. schedule.

So without further ado - my day:

* **Before 7am (preferably 6:30am):** GET UP. Make some coffee and oatmeal. Sit down at my computer. Contemplate if there's time. Or meditate.
* **7am - 11am**: Get an overview of what needs to be done. Open my über cool [pomodoro](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) timer app and get to work.
* **11am - 1pm**: Lunch and gym (also shower)
* **1pm - ~5pm**: Got more work to do? Go to a café. Order an americano and get going. Also meetings. And catching up with friends family etc.
* **5pm - ~8pm**: Dinner and quality time with the missus or friends.
* **8pm - ~23am**: Got even more work? (really? It won't be quality at this time, so it better be routine stuff.) Do it! If not: Write blog posts. Watch tv. Have fun. Contemplate.
* **Before 12am**: Go to bed already.

So that's my new day! Not getting up to early. I don't need the early mornings to have quiet time. I work mostly from home and my girlfriend leaves before 7am anyway, so I have plenty of wiggle room for my brain to operate in. Also blocked out time for *not work*. This is key to not getting burned out (and keeping my SO). Still on really busy days I have a good 11 hours to work in!

I'll have more stuff on **pomodoro** and how this works out for me.
